This project was a University project for my web application development 1 module in which we were given two requirements. The first, to create a take home pay calculator based on an inputted tax & national insurance rate, the user had to be able to enter a gross pay
and select on of the following timeframes (yearly, monthly, weekly, hourly). Secondly, we had to create a vacancies portal which showed a list of recent job opening using a publicly available api.

# Key Takeaways

* Creating an interactive & responsive web page in pure HTML, CSS & JS makes me appreciate how lucky we are with frameworks such as angular & react.
* Feel like I improved technically within HTML, CSS, JS.
* Figured out how flex boxes work (sort of).
* Learnt that saving state in pure JS is quite a task.
* Got over the fear of working in front end.
* Finally I quite enjoyed this project.
